# ReTrackStudio

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§  

ReTrack.Studio is a sandbox Distributor platform: create quotes, convert to orders, manage inventory and reservations across warehouses, ship via carriers with tracking, and handle invoicing and payments - with clean APIs and realistic seed data.

It powers BackendToBytes as a hands-on sandbox that bridges Backend Engineering and Data Engineering. On the app side you'll have realistic REST workflows, and on the Warehouse side analytics/data modeling.

Not production-ready - built for education only.
